Based on your priorities, here's my recommended solution:

REST API: For your messaging API, I recommend building a REST API using a lightweight web framework like Flask or Gin. REST APIs are simple to build and easy to use, and they're widely supported by clients and servers. You can use HTTP long polling or WebSockets for real-time messaging.

Go: Go is a great choice for building your backend infrastructure. It's fast, scalable, and easy to use, with a simple syntax and excellent support for concurrency. Go is well-suited for building microservices and REST APIs.

Database: For your database, I recommend using MongoDB. MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document database that's well-suited for chat interfaces. It provides good scalability, high availability, and a flexible data model. MongoDB is often used with tools like RabbitMQ, Kafka, and Elasticsearch for messaging and data processing.

User authentication: For user authentication, I recommend using a third-party authentication service like Auth0 or Okta. These services provide a secure and reliable way to authenticate users and control access to your chat interface.

Integration with other systems: To integrate your chat interface with other systems, I recommend using a third-party integration tool like Zapier or Tray.io. These tools provide an easy and flexible way to integrate with a wide range of enterprise applications, including CRM, ERP, and project management tools.

Overall, this solution should provide a scalable and secure backend infrastructure for your chat interface, with a simple and easy-to-use REST API, a fast and efficient Go backend, and a flexible and reliable MongoDB database. By using third-party authentication and integration services, you can reduce development time and ensure that your chat interface integrates seamlessly with other enterprise applications.
